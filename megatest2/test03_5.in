// Test 3.5
// T1 should not abort because its site did not fail.
// In fact all transactions commit
// x8 has the value 88 at every site except site 2 where it won't have
// the correct value right away but must wait for a write to take place.
// The reason is that the W(T2,x8,88)
// will not commit and is lost on failure.
// Even though site 2 recovers before T2, T2 will not retroactively
// write to the site (in any practical version of available copies).
